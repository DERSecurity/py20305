"""Unit coverage for the release SBOM generator.

This module decides what every published SBOM says and enforces the check
that keeps build-machine detail out of a public document, and none of it was
covered. The cases below are the ones that have actually gone wrong, each
kept as a regression:

* a scoped npm name emitted a PURL that does not resolve;
* a transitive package was described as a direct dependency of the project;
* a trove classifier became an SPDX id in one document and stayed free text
  in the other, so the pair disagreed;
* the publication check matched a UUID this tool generates, and separately
  exempted a repository whose name merely began with an allowlisted one;
* the document identifier ignored everything except names and versions, so
  two materially different documents could share one identity.
