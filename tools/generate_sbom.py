"""Build the release SBOM for this project in CycloneDX and SPDX form.

Both documents are emitted from one component model so they cannot disagree.
The model is assembled from two inputs:

* the CycloneDX document produced by ``cyclonedx-py environment`` against a
  venv built from the locked runtime dependencies. That scan is what supplies
  package metadata the lockfile does not carry: declared licenses, project
  URLs, descriptions, and the resolved dependency graph.
* ``uv.lock``, which supplies the distribution artifact hashes and the index
  each package was resolved from. The environment scan cannot know these
  because installed metadata does not retain them.

Usage:
    python tools/generate_sbom.py \
        --cyclonedx build/sbom/environment.cdx.json \
        --uv-lock uv.lock \
        --version 1.2.3 \
